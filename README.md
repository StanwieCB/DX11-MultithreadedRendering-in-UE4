# DX11-MultithreadedRendering-in-UE4

This is a public demo I built at Intel Visual Computing Enabling Group. Original demo is included in DX11 SDK examples.

## Why This?
### Mesh Number
Up to 1015 meshes in a single scene

### Draw Call Number
More than 4k draw calls in a single scene

### Static & Stationary & Movable
Object types vary in all three types defined in UE4. Feel free to change it and make your own test suite.

We welcome developers to test their own UE4 parallel rendering performance with this basic demo!
